<<About BPS>>

	<<Beam Processing Service (BPS)>> is an <<unified batch and stream processing model>> that can be used to create a data processing pipeline based on simple flow.
	
	\
	Since BPS provides higher level of abstraction for input and output, user is left to focus on domain specific logic and create a simple flow design to describe it.\
	Flow design is based on strong conventions and best practices, which allow you to rapidly create, test and verify domain specific logic.

What is the main focus of BPS?
	
	Main focus of BPS is to leave <<user free to focus on business logic and reuse templates>> already provided by BPS for data processing.
	This also means that any sort of data source and data sink can be used in order to accommodate users business logic based on the order of execution steps.\ 




Beam Processing Service SDKs

    Beam Processing Service SDKs provide declarative and programming APIs for defining, extraction, loading and creation of analytics application on any data set in a batch or nearly real time fashion. BPS provides template based approach that generates 75% or more code at time of creation so developer can focus on business logic. Use the Beam Processing Service SDK of your choice to build a program that defines your data processing pipeline.
    
	Beam Processing Service currently supports the following language-specific SDKs:

	
*-----------------------------------------------------*-------------------------------------------------------*
| Language                                            | SDK Status    								|
*-----------------------------------------------------*-------------------------------------------------------*
| {{{ https://java.com/en/ } Java }} | Active Development |
*--------------------------------------------------------*----------------------------------------------------*
| {{{ http://www.scala-lang.org/ } Scala }} | Coming Soon |
*--------------------------------------------------------*----------------------------------------------------*
| {{{ https://www.r-project.org/ } R }} | Planned for Future Releases |
*--------------------------------------------------------*----------------------------------------------------*
| {{{ https://www.python.org/ } Python }} | Planned for Future Releases |
*--------------------------------------------------------*----------------------------------------------------*

	BPS is platform open to external contributions, so other languages can be added. Community is invited to contribute.


Beam Processing Service Pipeline Runners

	Beam Processing Service Pipeline Runners interpret the data processing pipeline you define with your BPS program into the API compatible with the distributed processing back-end of your choice. When you run your BPS program, youâ€™ll need to specify the appropriate runner for the back-end where you want to execute your pipeline.

	Beam Processing Service currently supports Runners that work with the following distributed processing back-ends:

*-----------------------------------------------------*-------------------------------------------------------*
| Runner                                           | Status    								|
*-----------------------------------------------------*-------------------------------------------------------*
